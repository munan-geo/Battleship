# BattleShip

BattleShip is a turn-based two-player game that simulates a war between ships on an ocean.

Each player gets their own battle area with a certain number of ships placed in non-overlapping positions. The ships might be of different sizes.

Note, players cannot see each others ship's location.

The player who destroys all the ships of the other player first wins the game. The game ends in a draw if none of the players can destroy all of the otherâ€™s ships using a finite number of missiles.
